# How to Complete Homework

1. On GitHub, fork this repository.
2. `git clone` your fork to your computer.
3. Write some code, and frequently commit.
4. Use the testing scripts to see how many tests pass:<br />
	```
	testing/test_all.sh
	```
	or
	```
	testing/test_problem.sh [problem_name]
	```
5. Until either all the tests pass or your are satisfied, repeat steps 3 and 4.
6. `git push` to your fork.
7. Look at the README on this repository to see your semi-official scores (this should be updated automatically with CI).
8. At the due date, your fork will be cloned, and will be tests and looked through manually to ensure it is legit, and to give some human feedback on code structure.
